# HTB-Enumeration-Automation-Script
Automates HTB box enumeration: prompts for IP/domain, updates hosts file, runs Nmap scans, Feroxbuster for directories, and Gobuster for subdomains. Saves time and enhances efficiency in security assessments.

## Usage
1. Clone or download the script to your local machine.
2. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x htb.sh
   run with ./htb.sh
   provide IP and domain (for HTB it's usually "boxname.htb")
